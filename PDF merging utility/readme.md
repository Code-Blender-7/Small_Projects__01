## Python PDF merging utility


### Introduction -

A simple utility tool written in python that allows others to merge the contents of two or more pdf files of a folder into 1 super pdf file. 


### Caution -

Running this software requires python and PyPDF2 library.


Install the latest version of python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

*Guide to install PyPDF2 - *

```

pip install PyDF2

```

click [here](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/) for more details regarding the PyPDF2 library.


### Remarks

the utility software was just an idea i got while exploring random python libraries. Of course that there are other ways to improve the software for more "complex" usage. However, since this is only a test program with little importance. I decided to "not" upgrade the software for the time-being. </br>
However, if you find this software useful then hit me up on twitter and I gladly appreciate it. Thanks.
