## Python PDF merging utility


### Introduction

A simple utility tool written in python that allows others to merge the contents of two or more pdf files of a folder into 1 super pdf file. 


### Requirements

1. Python [(*See latest version here*)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. PyPDF2 [(*See how to install it here*)](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)

### Usage

1. Download the project folder from DownGit [here](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FCode-Blender-7%2FSmall_Projects__01%2Ftree%2Fmain%2FPDF%20merging%20utility).
2. Extract PDF_merger.py to your folder where you want to merge the PDFs.
3. Run PDF_merger.py.

### Remarks

the utility software was just an idea i got while exploring random python libraries. Of course that there are other ways to improve the software for more "complex" usage. However, since this is only a test program with little importance. I decided to "not" upgrade the software for the time-being. </br>
However, if you find this software useful then hit me up on twitter and I gladly appreciate it. Thanks.
