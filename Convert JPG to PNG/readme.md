# Introduction

The *'Convert to JPG to PNG'* is a python based program that uses the Python Imagining Library(**PIL**) to convert any JPG in a single folder and turn them into a PNG format. 

This program is a highly versitile because it is developed to work in any kind of folder without making direct changes to the script's code.

The best feature of this program is that it is a **single click-open** action. Meaning that it doesn't need the location of a folder, any parameter or input. The program has the feature of converting **all the files at once** meaning that you don't need to keep selecting one file, convert it and and repeat again and again.

For the self-aware people, the program is coded to create a new text file where the **logs of actions** would be present. 

However, to use this software, you have to paste it on the target directory where the photos and images are located. You don't really need a editor or a terminal to manually run it. 

Just clicking on the program gets the job done.



##Varients of the Program - 
When I was reseaching and developing the software, I realized that creating multiple versions of the program can aid in the use of this software in your day-to-day life. 

There are two varients of the program - 

1. <u>*script_mode1.py*</u> - Converts the files into PNG by default. Creates a new folder on the 	directory where you launched it and saves the converted files on that newly created folder. Does not delete the 

2. <u>*script_mode2.py*</u> - Converts the files into a PNG by default. Doesn't create new folder. Instead, deletes the original files leaving the converted files.




###Here is a table for the summary of the varient's feature -

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Name of the Varient        | Functions                 | 
| -------------------------- | ------------------------  |
| script_mode1.py            | ✅Converts JPG to PNG</br>✅Creates a script log</br>✅Keeps the original files</br>✅Creates a new folder to keep the converted files</br>❌Requires authorization of action |
| script_mode2.py            | ✅Converts JPG to PNG</br>✅Creates a script log</br>❌Keeps the original files</br>❌Creates a new folder to keep the converted files</br>✅Requires authorization of action |


##Requirments

# Frequent Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. What can this script file really do?
```
Converts all the images in a file
```
2. How many images can this script file really convert?
```
Infinity. This script will not stop until all the .jpg are turned into .png
```
3. Is my computer at risk of getting virus attacked?
```
LMAO, Of course not. It has already been tested. The program cannot infect other files.
```
4. I am using a mac. Will it work in there?
```
I never used mac yet. But I doubt that it won't work. Because the program depends on the python internal code.
Therefore, the program should not crash.
```
5. The file is running. How do I stop it?
```
You can stop the file by using the keydownInterrupt error.
```
6. I accidently moved a bunch of new images on the folder where the script is currently converting. Will this program crash?
```
Possibly no. It converts the file in a from top to bottom. Possibly the file would get converted while the script is working. But the program may not crash. If does, please open up a new issue!
